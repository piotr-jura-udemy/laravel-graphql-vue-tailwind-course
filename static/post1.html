<div>
  With this type of relation, we don't have an example inside the application we'll built, but I've made a separate
  module you can download to see how the relation looks like. Do it now, and follow the instructions.

  You need to enable to school module in the AppModule, and add two entities to the TypeORM module config.

  As a reminder, many to many is a relation when entity A can be related to many B entities, but also B can be related
  to many A enitites. In our example mode, we have a Teacher and Subject. We assume 1 teacher can teach more than 2
  subjects, and of course, 1 subject at school is often teached by more than 1 teacher.

  To define this relationship you need to add <code class="bg-indigo-100 p-1 rounded-md text-xl">@ManyToMany</code> only
  on 1 of the entities. Then, you'd only be able to fetch related entities using this Entity. The `@JoinTable` is
  neccessary.

  However, it's probably more convienient to add the `@ManyToMany` on both entities. Remember, the `@JoinTable`
  decorator goes only on one entity.

  If you've properly registered the module, you can take a look at the database structure. You should notice 3 new
  tables, not 2. The `teacher_subjects_subject` is the table that holds relations between the 2 entities. This table
  name is configurable using the `name` property of the `@JoinTable` options. Again, you might want or need to configure
  it, especially if you're working with a pre-existing database.

  Then, `joinColumn` sets the options for the owning side, Teacher in our case - as a reminder, Teacher is the owning
  side as it has the `@JoinTable` decorator. `name` is the column name in the join table, `referencedColumnName` is the
  name of the column to point to in the `teacher` table.

  You can configure the same for the other side, using the `inverseJoinColumn`.

<div>
  The third way, is to use the `cascade` option of the relation. When you you have an Event with related Attendees,
  fetched eagerly or explicitly, it feels natural to add an `Attendee` to `attendees` property array and just save an
  `Event`. This won't save the attendees though, unless you set the cascade on the relation to true, or list all
  possible cascade options in an array.

  Note, this is not equal to database level cascading - this is a TypeORM only thing. For those of you not well-versed
  with databases, cascading is a feature allowing you, for example to remove a table row and trigger the removal of all
  its related rows from different related tables.

  <pre><code class="text-xl">import Vue from 'vue';
import VueHighlightJS from 'vue-highlight.js';
import 'highlight.js/styles/default.css';
import App from './App';

Vue.use(VueHighlightJS, {
	// Register only languages that you want
	languages: {
		css,
		javascript,
		vue
	}
});

new Vue({
	el: '#app',
	render: h => h(App)
});</code></pre>

  If we set this option to true, which, let me say it again is not a database level CASCADE, it's just for TypeORM,
  everytime you add or remove relations on entity and them save the main entity, TypeORM will perform all `INSERTs`,
  `UPDATEs` and `REMOVALs` on the main entity and related entities.

<div>
  Do it with extra caution and consideration. This has a performance cost. Making all relations eager, without a good
  reason, can quickly spiral out of control.

  Even when the relation is configured as eager loading, you can skip it in the find and findOne methods, by setting
  `loadEagerRelations` to `false`.

  If the relation does not load eagerly, you can still load the relations you need, using the `relations` property. It's
  an array of strings, specify the Entity relation property name there, like `attendees.`

import VueHighlightJS from 'vue-highlight.js';
import 'highlight.js/styles/default.css';

	// Register only languages that you want
	languages: {

		javascript,
		vue
	}
});

new Vue({
	el: '#app',
	render: h => h(App)
