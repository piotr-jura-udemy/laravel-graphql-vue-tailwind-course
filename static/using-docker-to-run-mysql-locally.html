## Step 1 - Create docker-compose.yml
The below `docker-compose.yml` defines 2 services. The MySQL image, using the specific version (8.0.23) and Adminer, a web-based database manager.
It overrides the default command to enable password authentication. `restart` will make sure the container is restarted when anything goes wrong.
The `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable specifies the `root` user password. Though not used here, you can also use `MYSQL_DATABASE` to create a database on startup. Full list of environment variables is available <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql" class="border-b-4 border-red-300 hover:bg-red-300  dark:hover:text-gray-700">here</a>.</div>
```yaml
docker-compose.yml
version: "3.8"

services:
mysql:
image: mysql:8.0.23
command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
restart: always
environment:
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
ports:
- 3306:3306
adminer:
image: adminer
restart: always
ports:
- 8080:8080
``
## Step 2 - Run docker-compose
When you start Docker containers based on images you've never used before, they need to be downloaded first. First time start-up might take a little while longer. Run `docker-compose up` to download and start MySQL & Adminer. Use the `-d` flag to start containers in the background. If you run containers in the background, you can stop them anytime by running `docker-compose stop`. Otherwise, use `Ctrl+C`.
